CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan
<br>
Name: Nickolas Jucker
<br>
<strong>Goals:</strong>
<br>
To increase customer influx by 50% and to attract a younger individuals or families within the age bracket of 15 to 30 years of age while also keeping its appeal to the orginal bracket of 35 to 50.  
<br>
<strong>Success Evaluation:</strong>
<br>
The sites success will be evalutated in two counts; one being the number of sign ups increase by 50% of their usual 100 weekly players and also factoring in from these sign ups that the ages of these new members are between 15 to 30 years of age.
<br>
<strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<br>
1.The company aims to include a new demographic into their audience base of 35 to 50 years of age. Their desired new demographic range is from 15 to 50 years of age if successful.
<br>
2. To reach such a broad audience the site will have to be constructed with an age neutral theme in mind. The color spectrum that'll be used wont be harsh or bland but a nice neutral groud of 'beachy' colors to complement the volleyball orianted website which won't turn away any users that click on the site. 
<br>
Example color template:
<br>
<img src="Images/beachycolors.png" width="150" height="40" alt="beachy colors"/>
<br> Text will be a middle ground of being both large enough to read for the higher age group while being not overbearing and turning away the younger users. The webbing or navigation of the website will be simplistic and straight to the point so that users wont get distracted or bored and leave the site this includes the call to action button, it'll be made visably clear and won't be a hassle to fill out and submit.
