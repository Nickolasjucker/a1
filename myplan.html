CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan
<br>
Name: Nickolas Jucker
<br>
<strong>Goals:</strong>
<br>
To increase customer influx by 50% and to attract a younger individuals or families within the age bracket of 15 to 30 years of age while also keeping its appeal to the original bracket of 35 to 50. The propose of a website is to reach a broader audience as a lot of people these days are very internet orientated so generally it is a good business option for small companies to take up their own website to make people aware of them which will potentially increase their overall business.    
<br>
<strong>Success Evaluation:</strong>
<br>
The sites success will be evaluated in two counts; One being the number of sign ups increasing by 50% of their usual 100 weekly players and seeing a breakdown of the forms information showing the age demographic if it hit the lower margin of 15 to 35 and if entire families are signing up together.
<br>
<strong>Target Audience:</strong>
<br>
1. The company aims to include a new demographic into their audience base of 35 to 50 years of age. Their desired new demographic range is from 15 to 50 years of age and to have young families attend and play together if successful.
<br>
2. To reach such a broad audience the site will have to be constructed with an age neutral theme in mind. The color spectrum that'll be used won’t be harsh or bland but a nice neutral ground of 'beachy' colors to complement the volleyball oriented website which won't turn away any users that click on the site. 
<br>
Example color template:
<br>
<img src="Images/beachycolors.png" width="150" height="40" alt="beachy colors"/>
<br> Text will be a middle ground of being both large enough to read for the higher age group while being not overbearing and turning away the younger users. The webbing or navigation of the website will be simplistic and straight to the point so that users won’t get distracted or bored and leave the site, this includes the call to action button. It will be made visibly clear and won't be a hassle to fill out and submit.
